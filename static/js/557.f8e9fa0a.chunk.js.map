Brute force allows the builder to guarantee the most \"optimal\" optimization target results. Since brute force is a very inefficient process, a lot of optimizations have been done around it to speed up the build process.</Typography>\n      <Typography gutterBottom>\n        The main way the builder reduces build time is by pruning \"inferior\" artifacts from the calculation space before the permutations for all the artifact combinations are calculated. (These account for the \"skipped\" builds number displayed during build generation). This also means that \"maximum\" stats filters does not work with the pruning algorithm, since it would interfere with the definition of \"inferior\".\n      </Typography>\n      <Typography>\n        Pruning, along with multi-threading, can do a lot to reduce build time. However, it is up to the user to configure the remaining build settings to get further reductions in build time, e.g. reducing the number of builds to display, restricting the number of main stats... etc.\n      </Typography>\n    </Grid>\n  </Grid>\n}"],"names":["ImgFullwidth","styled","width","height","BuildInfoDisplay","container","rowSpacing","spacing","item","xs","md","lg","variant","component","display","flexDirection","gap","src","overview","preview","gutterBottom","color","sx","mt"],"sourceRoot":""}
